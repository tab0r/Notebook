Baseline: 32 quotes out of 595 viewers (5.37% send quotes, 0% change from baseline/self)
Variation 1: 30 quotes out of 599 viewers (5.00%, -0.37%)
Variation 2: 18 quotes out of 622 viewers (2.89%, -2.48%)
Variation 3: 51 quotes out of 606 viewers (8.41%, +3.05%)
Variation 4: 38 quotes out of 578 viewers (6.57%, +1.20%)

Depending on our business model, we may want the form which simply generates the most quotes, or we want the form which generates the most orders. If we're taking a fee at both ends of the order, a more detailed analysis is needed. In particular, we need to know percentages of quotes which are accepted. Since that data is not present, I'll assume we only make money on the quotes sent, to make the set more actionable.

From this data, I would begin with an analysis of variation 2, to find potential problems.
Assuming the form doesn't contain any technical errors, I would set it aside to focus on the other variations. Variation 3 created the most positive and largest magnitude change, so I would want to know how it differs from the baseline. Again, I would check for technical errors as the magnitude of change makes me suspicious. But, my initial recommendation is to put variation 3 into use, if there's no budget for further research.

If variation 2 contained technical errors, I would want a second run with those problems corrected. If it did not, I would want a second run without it, and some modifications to variation 1. The percent change in variation 1 is small enough that we're not learning much about it.

Assuming we can continuously analyze this data and tweak the form, I would seek iterations of the experiment which bring the values closer and closer together, until differences are statistically insignificant. At that point, we would need a major change to the form or we'd have a set of forms which simply need selection based on aesthetic.
