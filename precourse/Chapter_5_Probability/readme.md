# Chapter 5: Probability

### This is a chapter that gives you the opportunity to cover many basic topics in probability.

## Learning Objectives
A basic understanding of probability and statistics is vital to becoming a
data scientist. After all, that is what makes you different from a software
engineer. Please complete this chapter before moving on to statistics chapters.

  - Counting: permutation/combination (python module: `itertools`)
  - Conditional probability and Bayes formula
  - Probability distributions for discrete random variables (Binomial, Geometric and Poisson distributions)
  - Probability distributions for continuous random variables (Uniform, Normal and Exponential distributions)
  - Generating simulations in python (python module `scipy` and in particular `scipy.stats`)

## Main Resources
If you feel like you need a review, there are very abridged lecture notes in
the [resources folder](resources/) that will catch you up to speed. Here is a recommended order to read the lecture notes in:

 - [combinatorics lecture](resources/combinatorics_lecture.pdf)
 - [conditional probability lecture](resources/conditional_probability_lecture.pdf)
 - [random variables lecture](resources/random_variables_lecture.pdf)
 - [binomial distribution lecture](resources/binomial_lecture.pdf)
 - [poisson distribution lecture](resources/poisson_lecture.pdf)
 - [normal and exponential distributions lecture](resources/normal_exponential_lecture.pdf)

## Assignments

The following assignments cover various aspects of basic probability theory. They represent the baseline understanding you need to have about probability to understand the course material we are going to cover in the future weeks. They also allow you to use `itertools` module once more, as well as to use `scipy.stats`.

### 1. Counting

The first assignment focuses on counting, with permutations and combinatorics. Answer the 4 questions in the [assignment_1_counting.md](assignments/assignment_1_counting.md).

### 2. Conditional probability

The second assignment is centered on conditional probability, with many several applications of Bayes formula. Answer the 3 questions on [assignment_2_conditional_proba.md](assignments/assignment_2_conditional_proba.md).

### 3. Probability distributions for discrete and continuous random variables

The third assignment gives you the opportunity to explore 3 probability distributions for discrete random variables (Binomial, Geometric, Poisson) and 3 probability distributions for continuous random variables (Uniform, Normal, Exponential). Take a look at [assignment_3_probability_distribution.md](assignments/assignment_3_probability_distribution.md). You will write some simple python functions to compute a probability of interest. One of the strategy used in this assignment is to simulate experiments by generating samples from given distributions.
