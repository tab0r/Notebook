__Goal__: Get you ready to jump into our curriculum on day 1

Please read this entire document before getting started on the individual sections.

Before classes begin, you are expected read the contents in each chapter, complete the code assignments for every chapter, and turn them in.

Please complete and hand in each chapter sequentially.

### How to submit the assignments.
You will submit your solutions with a git [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Here are step-by-step instructions of how to do this:

1. Fork this repository (go to https://github.com/zipfian/precourse and click "Fork")
1. [Install git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) on your computer
if you haven't already
1. Clone your forked repository onto your computer: `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/precourse`
1. Edit the assignment files with your solutions
1. Add your changes to the repository: `git add <file you edited>`
1. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "My solutions to precourse"`
1. Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin master`
1. Make a pull request by going to `https://github.com/<your username>/precourse` and clicking "Pull Requests" and then "New Pull Request". Then click "Create Pull Request". Put your name in the pull request title and then click "Create Pull Request" again.

It's good idea to commit and push to your personal fork often, even when you're not done. Then you have older versions of your work in case you screw something up or lose something. We will get a notification of your submission once you submit a pull request.

### Common git issues
1. If we've made changes to the repository after you forked it and you want to update your repository to reflect them, you can run this command: `git pull https://github.com/zipfian/precourse master`

2. If you try to push and get "Repository does not exist" this probably means that you cloned from the Zipfian repo rather than your fork. Make sure you did step 1 and created a fork. Then run this command to push: `git push https://github.com/<your username>/precourse master`
