# Shell

## Installing
When you write things in a terminal in Mac or GNU/Linux, you are writing shell.

If you are running Windows, you can install a shell by [installing
Git](http://git-scm.com/download/win), which you need for the git work anyway.
Open the shell by clicking the "Git Bash" option in the context menu.
