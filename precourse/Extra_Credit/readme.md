## Operating system
We'll use provide standard GNU/Linux computers during the course, so you won't
need to install any special software on your own computer, but it would be good
if you got familiar with Unix-like systems.

If you use already use GNU/Linux or Mac, you're fine.

If you use Windows, consider installing a GNU/Linux distribution, and try using
it for your general computing. [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download) is one of
the easier ones to set up.

## Text editor
You'll be writing lots of text files, so you'll be using a text editor a lot.
Ordinarily, you'll be able to use any editor that you want.

I like [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Sometimes, you'll need to edit text files on a remote server without a graphical
interface, so it would be good if you familiarized yourself with a non-graphical
text editor. A simple one is nano. [Here](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/)'s a tutorial.

If you are up for a challenge, you can try vim or emacs. We tend to use vim, but
they're both great. Here are some tutorials you can try.

* [How to learn Emacs](http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/howtolearn.html)
* [vim adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/)

## Web programming

While the course will not explicitly cover web programming technologies, it will be essential to understand how the internet/websites work as you will be obtaining data from it as well as publishing results to it. A great basic tutorial to creating a dynamic website with Flask can be found here: [http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/)

Here is a colleciton of the best resources I could find out there: [Bitly bundle](http://bitly.com/bundles/o_57ca5qnmvg/1)

### TODO

You by no means are expected to go through all of those resources. I will outline below a recommended track and how to test your knowledge.  If you already know these topics, feel free to skip things.

Tools to use:
* [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/) with Code School [course](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/discover-devtools) or [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/): Essential to inspect a web page and understand what is happening behind the scenes.
* [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/): HTML and CSS interactive editor -- great to experiment and see changes in real time.
