Blog
=======
We would like all the students to blog throughout the course and reflect on what they have learned.

You are welcome to use any blog software you like.
Many of you already have blogs, that's great; you
don't need to switch software.

Here we suggest two options.

* [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com), with a [command-line client](http://code.google.com/p/tumblr-cli/)
* A static blog generator, like [Blogofile](http://www.blogofile.com) or [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/),
    with hosting on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com) or [S3](http://console.aws.amazon.com)
* [Scriptogram](http://scriptogr.am/): Save your posts as Dropbox files
* [Jounlr](https://journlr.com/): Save blog posts as Evernote notebooks
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/): The latest and greatest hostness (plus it uses node.js ;)

We like both of these because you can store your blog posts
as ordinary text files in a git repository.
