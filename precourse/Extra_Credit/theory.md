# Introduction to Statistics and Probability

This section of the pre-course curriculum is intended to refresh your background on probability, statistics, and linear algebra.  This readme consists of a linear path to follow interspersed with exercises to turn in, lecture videos to add relevant context, and lecture slides to serve as a guide.  Where noted, the relevant chapters from the associated textbooks have been linked for a deeper theoretical dive into the material.

## Assignment

1. Follow along with [these](http://courses.washington.edu/css490/2012.Winter/lecture_slides/02_math_essentials.pdf) slides.
2. Watch Andrew Ng's machine learning [lectures](../lectures/videos) on linear algebra (downloaded and stored in this repo).

### What do I need to know?

As long as the above [slides](http://courses.washington.edu/css490/2012.Winter/lecture_slides/02_math_essentials.pdf) make sense to you (and you could follow along with Andrew Ng's lectures) you should be prepared for the first day of Zipfian.  There is a lot of content in this readme, by no means are you expected to know all of it.  And if you did you probably wouldn't need us ;)
