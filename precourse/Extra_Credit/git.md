# Git
git is a distributed version control system (dvcs) that allows developers
to easily commit and rollback changes and collaborate with one another.
We'll use it everyday in class.

## Install Git
GNU/Linux: install git from your package manager;
it'll probably be called "git".

Mac: install with MacPorts or Homebrew (install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
if you don't have either).

Windows: download and install git from the 
[Git website](http://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Readings
You should understand (or be familiar with) the things in the following
materials. If you already know these topics, feel free to skip things.

You don't have to memorize anything; we mainly want you to know about these
things and feel comfortable typing things in a terminal.
