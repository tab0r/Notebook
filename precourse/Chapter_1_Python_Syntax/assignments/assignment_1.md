# Assignment: Practice with built-ins functions

## Objectives

- List comprehensions
- `map`, `reduce`, `filter` and lambda functions
- indexing and slicing
- `enumerate` and `zip` functions
- `join` and `sort` methods
- `combinations` and `permutations` from `itertools` module

## Questions & Answers

Fill out functions in assignments 1a through 1e.

- [Assignment 1a:](../code/assignment_1a.py) Practice using the `map` function and list comprehensions with [assignment_1a.py](../code/assignment_1a.py). With `map` functions you will be using the lambda operator/function, which is an easy way to create a quick, anonymous functions that will not need to be re-used. List comprehensions will allow you to achieve the same result without lambda operators. There are 7 functions to fill.

- [Assignment 1b:](../code/assignment_1b.py) Practice writing `lambda x: f(x)` functions with `filter` and `reduce`. There are 5 functions to complete in [assignment_1b.py](../code/assignment_1b.py).

- [Assignment 1c:](../code/assignment_1c.py) Practice some more using indexing and slicing in 4 functions with [assignment_1c.py](../code/assignment_1c.py)

- [Assignment 1d:](../code/assignment_1d.py) Practice some useful functions `enumerate` and `zip` as well as the methods `join` and `sort` with [assignment_1d.py](../code/assignment_1d.py). There are 6 functions for you to complete.

- [Assignment 1e:](../code/assignment_1e.py) Practice using `itertools` module, in particular `combinations` and `permutations`. There are only 2 functions to fill in for this [assignment_1e.py](../code/assignment_1e.py). Take the time to understand how `generators` and `iterators` work.

## Extra resources

You should be able to use resources like Python documentation or [Stack Overflow](http://www.http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) to find any information you need. However, if you feel a little overwhelmed, the lecture [notes](resources/python.md) cover most of these python topics.
